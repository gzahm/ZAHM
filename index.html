            <h2>Booking Bali </h2>
            <p>We chose Bali because we were looking for a destination that offered a unique culture, delicious food, memorable beaches, and epic adventures ‚Äî all in one place. Bali checked all of these boxes, both before and in hindsight.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, traveling to Bali from the US takes significant travel time, with about 2-3 days lost to flights and layovers. Additionally, you‚Äôll likely experience some jet lag due to the 13-hour time difference between Texas and Bali. While this shouldn‚Äôt discourage you from visiting, be prepared for some weariness upon arrival. However, despite the long journey, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend spending any less than a full week in Bali.</p>

<p>As a baseline, we found our 8-night stay to be ideal if you‚Äôre focusing solely on the island of Bali. When planning our trip, we decided that our arrival and departure should be relaxed and close to the airport, with days in between dedicated to exploring culture and adventure.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs how we structured our trip: 2 nights in Sanur, 3 nights in Ubud, 2 nights in Canggu, and 1 night in Seminyak. We rely heavily on Chase Sapphire Points for our travels, so we exclusively booked our accommodations through the Chase travel portal and one of its partners, The World of Hyatt.</p>

<p>For our flights, we traveled with American Airlines and Cathay Pacific, taking the route from Dallas to Los Angeles, Los Angeles to Hong Kong, and finally, Hong Kong to Denpasar. We booked these flights through Expedia about two months before our late-September trip in 2024.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title">Bali Beach Vibes and Culture</h2>
            <p class="post-date">Published on October 29, 2024</p>

<p>Bali is well known for its beautiful beaches, and among those, you‚Äôll find a variety to consider ‚Äî each offering its own unique pros and cons. For our trip, we planned three types of beach experiences: relaxing, active, and picturesque. Of course, these vibes can coexist at different locations, and there are countless spots to explore on the island. However, we‚Äôve categorized them this way to help those who have never visited Bali or who are planning a trip and need to narrow down their choices.</p>

<p>Beyond its stunning beaches, Bali is also home to lush forests, winding rivers, exotic rice terraces, and grand volcanoes. Exploring these natural wonders was a must for us, so we made it a point to distinguish our beach experiences from our more outdoorsy, nature-filled days by incorporating a longer stay in Ubud, Bali‚Äôs cultural heart.</p>

<p>One thing we didn‚Äôt initially prioritize in our planning, despite it being on our checklist of reasons to visit Bali, was the culture. The culture permeates all aspects of life on the island and is deeply intertwined with Balinese Hinduism. Luckily, our tour guides and drivers not only helped us navigate the beautiful sights but also introduced us to Balinese traditions through insightful conversations and well-timed stops.</p>

<p>Gaining an understanding of these traditions proved pivotal in fully appreciating Bali and having a well-rounded experience. It‚Äôs not just about seeing the sights ‚Äî it‚Äôs about experiencing the way of life that makes Bali so special.</p>

<p>For a visual taste of what you may want to experience during your stay, I highly recommend watching this Bali video:</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Sanur: A Calmer Side of Bali</h2>
    <p class="post-date">Published on October 29, 2024</p>

    <p>Sanur, located on the eastern front of Bali, is considered a calmer part of the island. Here, we booked a two-night stay at The Andaz through The World of Hyatt. We were expecting beachy and relaxing vibes, especially since all we had seen up to this point were the views from our taxi ‚Äî that of a developing country intermingled with areas of significant economic investment.</p>

    <p>Without realizing it, we had booked the most "Bali‚Äôesque" resort of all. First off, like all the hotels we stayed at during our trip, the greetings were second to none. The welcome felt like that of a son returning home to his loving parents after ages away. We were greeted with cold rolled towelettes and a refreshing iced tea beverage.</p>

    <p>Upon arrival, we were led through the outdoor corridors of The Andaz. The property was gorgeous ‚Äî trees, vines, and plants of all sorts were masterfully incorporated into the buildings as if they were meant to coexist in perfect harmony. In one ear, you could hear the chirping of birds, while in the other, the subtle sounds of water features gently sprinkling and flowing.</p>

    <p>Each receptor in your nose buzzed with the fresh scents of flowers, coastal mist, and Korean BBQ. You couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if this was the one true paradise. The humidity was slight, only to be whisked away by the occasional beach breeze. If the travel felt rough, this was the moment it all melted away. One deep breath, and you realized: you are in Bali.</p>

    <p>Our standard room, without any upgrades, exceeded all expectations. It felt like a room fit for royalty. We ended the evening with a stroll down the beach, exploring the various dinner options, and finally ‚Äúsettled‚Äù on BBQ on the beach. It was a buffet of meats, salads, and fillers ‚Äî all at astonishingly low prices.</p>

    <p>As a note for those budgeting, the cost of food in Bali is much cheaper than in the United States, but alcohol is often priced similarly or even higher in some cases.</p>

  <h2>üåè Nusa Penida </h2>
  <h3>Exploring Nusa Penida: A Day Trip from Sanur</h3>
  <p>
    On our first morning in Bali, we embarked on an unforgettable day trip that started with a 45-minute boat ride from Sanur on Bali‚Äôs east coast. We explored Nusa Penida, a stunning island considered part of Bali, with two main tourist attractions on opposite sides. The famed Diamond Beach, with its breathtaking white sands and cliffs overlooking turquoise waters, offers postcard-worthy views. While it's perfect for an overnight stay to enjoy leisurely, day-trippers like us get a quick window to capture the magic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Navigating Nusa Penida requires planning; the island's limited road infrastructure means travel can be slow. After Diamond Beach, we moved closer to the port, where we admired Kelingking Beach (known as T-Rex Beach), Angel‚Äôs Billabong, and Broken Beach. This spot is ideal for day-trippers, with the chance to enjoy these sights and perhaps some of Bali‚Äôs best snorkeling nearby. Reflecting on the experience, we‚Äôd recommend an overnight stay for those wanting to relax without the rush or choosing sights closest to the port for a more relaxed day trip.
