            <h2>Booking Bali </h2>
            <p>Our reason for choosing Bali was that we desired somewhere neither of us had traveled that offered a unique culture, good food, memorable beaches, and epic adventure. Bali checked the boxes, both before and in hindsight.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, with going to Bali from the US, you will lose 2-3 days of travel time, and you will be jet-lagged in some capacity (13-hour difference between Texas and Bali). This should not be a deterrent to going, though in the phase of traveling there may be some regret. However, I would not recommend a day short of a week of time in Bali.</p>

<p>For a baseline, I’d say our 8 nights in Bali were ideal if you were to just cover the island of Bali. When configuring our trip, we decided our arrival and departure should be relaxed and spent closer to the airport and by the beach, and that we’d tick the culture and adventure box on the days between.</p>

<p>Our trip looked like this: 2 nights in Sanur, 3 nights in Ubud, 2 nights in Canggu, and 1 night in Seminyak. Our household stands by Chase Sapphire Points, so for our stays, we only used our points through both the travel portal and through one of their partners, The World of Hyatt. (I’ll reference these as they come).</p>

<p>Our American Airlines / Cathay Airways flight was Dallas to Los Angeles, Los Angeles to Hong Kong, Hong Kong to Denpasar, which we booked through Expedia two months prior for our trip at the end of September 2024.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title">Bali Beach Vibes and Culture</h2>
            <p class="post-date">Published on October 29, 2024</p>

            <p>Bali is well known for its beaches, and among those beaches, you have a variety to consider, each with its own pros and cons. The trip we planned consisted of three types of beach vibes - relaxing, active, and picturesque. This is not to say that these vibes can’t coexist or that these are the only places on the island that exist as such, but to better generalize for those who have never visited Bali and maybe even those that plan to visit but must make a decision on which to visit.</p>

            <p>Bali is also home to lush forests, winding rivers, exotic rice terraces, and grand volcanoes. Exploring these parts was a must, so we made it a point to distinguish our beach portions of the trip from our outdoorsy, nature-filled portion by incorporating a longer stay in Ubud.</p>

            <p>One thing we did not consider heavily when planning our trip, despite knowing it was on our checklist of reasons to go to Bali, was the culture. The culture is found in all aspects of Bali life with heavy ties to Balinese Hinduism. Fortunately, our tour guides/drivers not only helped us navigate our journey through the beautiful sights, but they also incorporated stops and conversations regarding Balinese traditions. The understanding of these traditions is pivotal in having the complete Bali appreciation and experience.</p>

            <p>I suggest watching this Bali Video to get a better idea of what you may want to experience during your stay in Bali:</p>
