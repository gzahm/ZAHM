            <h2>Booking Bali </h2>
            <p>Our reason for choosing Bali was that we desired somewhere neither of us had traveled that offered a unique culture, good food, memorable beaches, and epic adventure. Bali checked the boxes, both before and in hindsight. Keep in mind, with going to Bali from the US, you will lose 2-3 days of travel time, and you will be jet lagged in some capacity (13 hour difference between Texas and Bali). This should not be a deterrent going, though in the phase of traveling there may be some regret, however, I would not recommend a day short of a week of time in Bali. For a baseline, I’d say our 8 nights in Bali was ideal if you were to just cover the island of Bali. When configuring our trip, we decided our arrival and departure should be relaxed and spent closer to the airport and by the beach, and that we’d tick the culture and adventure box on the days between. Our trip looked like this: 2 nights Sanur, 3 nights Ubud, 2 nights Canggu, 1 night Seminyak. Our household stands by Chase Sapphire Points, so for our stays we only used our points through both the travel portal, and through one of their partners, The World of Hyatt. (I’ll reference these as they come). Our American Airlines / Cathay Airways flight was Dallas to Los Angeles, Los Angeles to Hong Kong, Hong Kong to Denpasar, which we booked through Expedia two months prior for our trip at the end of September 2024.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Rice Terraces of Ubud</h2>

                The Ubud rice terraces are a stunning example of Bali’s natural beauty. 
                Walking through the lush green fields and terraces, I felt connected to the land and culture.
                The serenity of this place is truly magical.

                I had the chance to meet some local farmers and learn about their traditional rice farming methods.
                It was a humbling experience to see the hard work and dedication that goes into growing rice.
